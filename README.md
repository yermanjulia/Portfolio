# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website! I've built this site to showcase my work, share my journey and experiences in the tech field.

## Overview

This website was created using a multitude of modern technologies related to React and front-end development. Here's a brief overview of what the project uses:

- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface
- **Emotion**: Library designed for writing CSS styles with JavaScript
- **Material UI**: React UI framework for faster and easier web development
- **SASS**: CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such as variables, nested rules and mixins (functions) into regular CSS.
- **iTyped**: Implementation of a typewriter effect for the site's main landing page
